    # Error code goes here in this section; for debugging.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Current Bug - Bug Number = None - I am quite sure that visual placement for play_cards during valid_play_check_and_sort() are not proper. It looks like the meld nums, card nums, etc. are not properly calculated whenever pre-sorted visual arrangements are made.
# Current Bug - Bug Number = None - Whenever attempting to add wild_cards to temp_melds during valid_play_check_and_sort(), whenever it asks the player to choose a meld to add the wild card to, the game does not recognize any card clicks and never does anything or progresses any further. No crash, just no click recognition.
# Current Bug - Bug Number = None - Not Finished: game.progression_text_obj section; need to make it so that both of the text objs get blitted and that in the case that obj_2 was previously blitted that the 'erase' section is run in that instance as well as all of the others. Also need to finish loigc concerning whether or not when in this case 'obj' should be changed to none, then create 'obj_1' & 'obj_2', having the blit section chcek whether or not 'obj_1' & 'obj_2' are none, just as it # checks for all of the other renders...
# Current Bug - Bug Number = None - When playing a set of cards, it properly situated them, and the value was over 50 points, but instead game output said that I had (0) points from the play cards and denied the play.
