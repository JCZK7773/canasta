# THINGS TO DO
    # Work with bugs in bugs_debug.py & update the state of the bugs.
    # Add in else clause for card group name renderings so that whenever there is no cards in the card group it will 'erase' the preexisting / leftover text so that it doesn't get 'smeared' whenever cards pass over it before it is rendered again.
    # Make it so that card group text boxes are only visible whenever the associated card group is not empty.
    # Change the text outputs to be 'click-to-continue' instead of a time-based display.
    # Whenever adding wild cards to a choice of melds, add in code that displays an output message whenever a player clicks an attempted black 3 meld saying the player cannot add wild cards to black 3 melds. (Already made it so that they cannot be 'clicked' validly as a choice.)
    # Make all of the necessary changes to progression.py so that it will all operate smoothly. Take your time. Do it right.
        # Change progression.py so that all melds are instances of CustomAppendList & are assigned the proper card_group_names for proper visual placement.
        # Go through all code to ensure that all for loops are being broken out of whenever a condition is met, instead of continuing the iteration as this slows the execution of the code.
    # *Note: Is this accurate? I think I read up on this and loading them each time the image is reassigned is the only way to do it.* Pretty sure that I am loading the images each time I reassign the image. I think it would increase performance to load the image once and then just assign a variable to the image??
    # Implement delta timing frame system.
    # I think I tried this but it did not work. Change event_handler() so that the 'for event in pygame.event.get()' is instead 'for event in pygame.event.wait()'?? Or something along those lines. Supposedly this will reduce CPU usage. Perhaps I can call pygame.event.wait() in the progression loops ONLY whenever I am expecting user input. See NOTES for a paste of supposedly improved code snippet.
    # Move card creation, card ranks, card suits, and other attributes more properly associated with the Card class, into the Card class code base instead of being inside of the Deck class.
    # Change length of import words/characters (and variable & function names) to a lesser amount by using import xxxxxx AS x to improve readability, etc.
    # Add in card sounds & background music.
    # Post on web so others can check for bugs as well.
