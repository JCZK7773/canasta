# THINGS TO DO
    # Fix bug # 05
    # Add in visual resituation for play_cards.
    # Make final pass reviewing round_reset() and end-of-game functions.
    # Go through all for loops to ensure that I am using [:] where necessary to avoid errors. Note that even when referencing one list and popping from another list, if the lists share the same item that is being popped, the first list in the for loop being iterated through is affected by the pop and will cause the iterator to lose one iteration per popped item, causing massive issues.
    # Add in else clause for card group name renderings so that whenever there is no cards in the card group it will 'erase' the preexisting / leftover text so that it doesn't get 'smeared' whenever cards pass over it before it is rendered again.
    # Change the text outputs to be 'click-to-continue' instead of a time-based display.
    # Go through all code to ensure that all for loops are being broken out of whenever a condition is met, instead of continuing the iteration as this slows the execution of the code.
    # Implement delta timing frame system.
    # *Note: Is this accurate? I think I read up on this and loading them each time the image is reassigned is the only way to do it.* Pretty sure that I am loading the images each time I reassign the image. I think it would increase performance to load the image once and then just assign a variable to the image??
    # I think I tried this but it did not work. Change event_handler() so that the 'for event in pygame.event.get()' is instead 'for event in pygame.event.wait()'?? Or something along those lines. Supposedly this will reduce CPU usage. Perhaps I can call pygame.event.wait() in the progression loops ONLY whenever I am expecting user input. See NOTES for a paste of supposedly improved code snippet.
    # Add in card sounds & background music.
    # Post on web so others can check for bugs as well.
